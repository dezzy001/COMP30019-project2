## Question for Tutor

* How to do collision?
* Do we need to have two collider (one isTrigger, and the other is not)?
* Copyrights? (Music, and other relevant assests)
* Best way to handle player movement? (feels choppy)

## Additional Notes from Derek

* Untag the player to make it invinsible during cooldown period.


## Additional Notes on stuff to implement:

### Shop?
* currency?
* upgrade movement speed ... etc (do this before levels)
* show cursor in easy mode
* chips system like Nier (upgrades can be on/off)
  * mainly upgrading the stats
* slow mo for 5 sec (for everything, player slow as well)

* come up with more ideas

### Levels?
* maybe 10 normal levels, then 1 boss level
* make larger and more interesting levels

### UI and animations
* blur?
* spawn effect (lightning/laser from above)
* trail effect for Player and Seeking Projectile
* enemy death effect (particle system)
* when bullet hits enemy (glow + sound)

### Story?
* visual novel style
* dialogue with choices (binary or more)
* if player chooses one specific route, then enemy would be stronger and harder to beat
* or if player chooses another route, easier enemy + in game currency

### Collision (must)
* Steven watch tutorial
* Make everything collide properly
* enemy and players
* if player hits any enemy object, have IV cool down
   * ~ can upgrade IV cool down by a little bit

### How to save player data?
* Save data + info management
