## Question for Tutor

* Copyrights? (Music, and other relevant assests)

## Additional Notes from Derek

* Untag the player to make it invinsible during cooldown period.

## Additional Notes on stuff to implement:

### Shop?
* currency?
* upgrade movement speed ... etc (do this before levels)
* show cursor in easy mode
* chips system like Nier (upgrades can be on/off) - mainly upgrading the stats
* slow mo for 5 sec (for everything, player slow as well)
* come up with more ideas

### Levels?
* maybe 10 normal levels, then 1 boss level
* make larger and more interesting levels

### UI and animations
* ~~blur?~~ (done, pause menu now has blur)
* ~~spawn effect (lightning/laser from above)~~ (done)
* trail effect for Player and Seeking Projectile
* ~~enemy death effect (particle system)~~ (done)
* ~~when bullet hits enemy make sound~~ (done)
* when bullet hits enemy make glow effect 

### Story?
* visual novel style
* dialogue with choices (binary or more)
* if player chooses one specific route, then enemy would be stronger and harder to beat
* or if player chooses another route, easier enemy + in game currency

### Collision (must)
* Steven watch tutorial
* Make everything collide properly
* enemy and players
* if player hits any enemy object, have IV cool down
   * ~ can upgrade invulnerability cool down by a little bit

### How to save player data?
* Save data + info management (work in progress)

## Original Game Concept

# Ideas on skills and items
Upgrades System
===============================================================================
	- expand chip capcity

Items (takes capacity)
===============================================================================
Item capacity = 5, 10, 15, 20
	- according to item capacity, player can mix and match their own wanted items

different types of chips available:
	1. Invincibility cool down
	2. +1 player (make it so that it takes 10 capcity to equip)
			- can buy 2
			- can equip 2 at max (10 capacity each, limit capacity at 20)

	3. Shield (blocks 1 shot)
	4. + 5% more gold


	Invicibility chip +0.1 seconds for each equipped chip (maybe it will take 2 capacity)




Skills (does not take capacity, but limited to one at a time)
===============================================================================
	1. laser (must)
	2. melee attack (must)
	
	3. missiles coming out in circle shape
	4. can have a blade which spins out and stays there spinning for a while
	5. skill which makes you invincible for 3 seconds
	6. healing - can bring back one body part

	(Optional) implement player seeking missile



Cosmetics (does not take capacity)
===============================================================================
- Gold (player colour)
